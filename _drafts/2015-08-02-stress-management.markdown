Everybody is familiar with stress in the modern world and many of us experience it on a daily basis. Small amount of stress is very helpful to be productive and accomplish things. But oftentimes stress leads to burn out and depression. That's what I learned on my own experience.

Recently I changed job and moved to a different city and suddenly all my habits were broken, friends are not easily accessible and all the familiar places around have changed to new ones. At the same time my clients wanted me to deliver tasks fast and I became stressed out and depressed very quickly as a result.

Warning signs that something is not quiet well with mental health:
 - disruption of usual daily routine
 - social withdrawal
 - losing interest in things that brought joy before
 - desire to eat junkfood or cookies and drink cola, pepsi
 - no interest in life in general
Those are strong warning signs that point you to pay attention to your own wellbeing and investigate the cause and eliminate it.

Ways to help yourself get back on track:
 - regular exercise including a mile of jogging and heavylifting
 - socialize and try to share your condition with others in a positive way (positivity helps you too)
 - relax without work and get away
 - meditate preferably twice a day

Routines that prevent getting into depressive state:

 - regular meditation
 - socialization
