The point of this post is to explain Same-Origin Policy in modern web browsers. The feature was introduced in Netscape Navigator in order to protect sensitive webcontent from malicious script. And the idea is that script can easily access web content's DOM from the same origin and manipulate it. It's applied to iframe, child windows and out-of-browser communications like XHR requests (but not all).

My first experiment was to try to access DOM from the script that's hosted from different origin. We have two files here: main page and script that is included in the main page.
main page (that is hosted on http://host1.dev:8080):
{% highlight html %}
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
		<script src="http://host2.dev:8081/service.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}
included script (that is hosted on http://host2.dev:8081):
{% highlight javascript %}
var element = document.querySelector('h1');
console.log('service.js started');
console.log(element);
{% endhighlight %}

And the output to browser's console is:
{% highlight html %}
service.js started
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
{% endhighlight %}

I was confused by this because standard says that script from different origin can not access the DOM, but it definitely can in our example.
Actually Same-Origin Policy is not applied to `<script>` tag as well as `<img>` and others because that's responsibility of the website owner to be careful about what content is included into the webpage
